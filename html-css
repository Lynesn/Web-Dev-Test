    <p>This can be a place you come to download your worries and ghosts with me. I have been thinking for a while about a place people can go to talk to someone that doesnt cost money or anything like that, but justa place you talk to someone who will never meet you and will never know you, a place you can just talk to a ghost human who actually wants to listen and also talks back. Not a computer or some form of technology, no attachments no strings but just laugh with them as a real friend or even cry with them and all they do is listen and also advise.</p>
      <p>The question though is, will you be able to trust them with all your personal or even private information? I do not see why not. This would be a total stranger who does not need to know your friends or family, a completely neutral person always there when you want to talk, they would refrain from judgement of any sort and only give advise when you want advise. They could talk about plants if thats what you want to talk about, they would talk about animals, nature, geography, religion, anything but the whole idea would be to listen to you, to help you take things off your chest without fear or judgement or even condemnation.Of course there would be a form you fill out first on privacy and terms and conditions before you can get an appointment. Do you know how many people have great friends and family but daily they look for that one neutral person who wouldnt judge them but just listen as they take things off their chest? Millions, but most importantly, this would be free.</p><br>
