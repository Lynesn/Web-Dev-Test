      Dear Tunga/ Kampabits,
    <div>
    <p><i><b>(Personal info)</i></b> I am a Ugandan female student of Computer Science online with University of the People from USA. I will be closing my year two of the four year degree in September 2019. I am currently unemployed and enjoying my time as a student. Thank you for the opportunity you have given me to try and develop a skill beyond my classroom.</p>
    
    <p><i><b>(Facts)</i></b> The truth is that a degree today in Computer Science will get your foot in the door for any tech interview, but only your skills will keep you there. And while I was fortunate to earn myself a scholarship at my university, all it is giving me are the foundations of the subject, then, I have to go look for other ways to get the skills hands on.Because I never had the means financially to join university in time, I have learnt to be my own cheerleader and motivator. I am passionate at what I do and I never stop till I get there.</p>
    
    <p><i><b>(What)</i></b> It is for this reason that I ask you for a chance to be a part of the new girl's software training, this will help me better compete in the field after my degree. Help me get a chance at knowledge I can't get in a classroom setting and I will make it my job to be one of the students that make you proud. I hope my humble request meets your kind consideration.</p><br>
    </div>
    Sincerely,<br><br>Naluwaga Lyne, S.
